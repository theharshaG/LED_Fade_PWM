# LED_Fade_PWM
This project demonstrates LED brightness control using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). The LED gradually fades in and fades out by varying the duty cycle.

## Components Used
- Arduino / ESP32
- LED
- 220Ω resistor
- Jumper wires

## How it work 
- PWM value increases from 0 to 255 → LED brightness increases
- PWM value decreases from 255 to 0 → LED brightness decreases
- The cycle repeats continuously

## what i used
- PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
- analogWrite()
- for loops
- Digital output control

## what i learned
- Understood PWM-based brightness control
- Learned to use loops for gradual transitions
- Gained hands-on experience with embedded programming
